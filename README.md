# Clone of Space Invader (Dumbed Down)
A simple Space Invader-esque type of game created using C++ and Glut.


# Description
A simple game project developed with Object Oriented guidelines. Due to time restrictions, my partner Jason and I were only able to create a game project that was simple in its core. We ultimated decided to take the approach of a Space Invade clone. Holistically speaking, the design and logic of our clone is a simple one stage game that require the user to shoot down enemy space ship that rotates in circular motion, while the user have free range of movements but only with 2 shot available. 

# Controls

A - moves left <br/>
S - moves down <br/>
D - moves right <br/>
Spacebar - shoot <br/>
F - toggle fullscreen <br/>
P - pause game <br/>

Z - restart <br/>
ESC - quit <br/>
